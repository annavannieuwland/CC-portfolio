      <h1>
       Design & Context 
      </h1>
COLOUR (MOOD) CHANGES UPON MOUSE LOCATION.
       <p>
      Cameras capture most often than not a mood. Sometimes more literally through captured facial expressions. Other times more indercetly, through a landscape or scene which is meant to evoke a feeling. 
      This camera offers to capture a persons mood anonymously. It does so rather by using colours rather than removing facial expressions. But facial expressions are often ambigiously and hard to pinpoint. 
      The moods of this camera is also ambigious. There are positive (orange) words, that are more visible in the complementary blue scene; There are less positive enforcements in blue that are more visible with its complementary colour mood red.   <p>    
It also allows someone to take pictures or selfies, somewhat anonymously.

Design Process 
      </h1> 
This topic really interested me, so I did some extra research around this topic to see what other issues are pressing and solutions are offered. I found a few interesting 'solutions' to privacy in face detection. I found this perticual one very interesting

      Camera 1: make up generator, inspired by this image, creating absurd make-up that 'distorts' the face.        <p>
      Camera 2: mood generator. Creating a camera which can show someone's mood while staying anonymous.
      Camera 3: basebal cap that creates a andy warhol style dot pop art over a wearers face. This plays off the research on ways to confuse facial recognition.
    <p>
      I went with camera idea 2, and added an extra layer of changing the colours. This was not only to convey a mood but also as a small statement against cameras working best for white skin. With this filter, only a red or blue tone can be perceived through the camera.
      </p>
          <h1>
Reflection
      </h1>
I have learned throughout the process of designing an unconventional camera that there are so many layers that can be added or removed to a camera. This does not only make it more interesting, but can also offer solutions to issues we sometimes are not even aware of. 
      It can offer both awareness as solutions. It also challanged the idea of "seeing," since we actively had to think through what we wanted to show (or not show).  
    <p>
      Research on this topic and this project also left me with the question that remains unanswered to me: "So if facial recognition is becoming high tech enough to recognize partially obscured faces, and it is illegal to completely mask your face, so what then? What can we do to protect our privacy?"
