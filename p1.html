      <p>
      I recently lost a treasured necklace that had been given to me as a wedding present a few years ago. The necklace’s pendant was hand-carved out of dark wood and then polished and strung on a very long, brass metal chain. 

The pendant was about the size of a quarter, with two flat faces and a soft, convex edge that was ⅓ of an inch thick. If you looked at the pendant while I was wearing it, it looked like a  teardrop that pointed down, or a google maps pin. In the round, circular area of the pendant, there was a centered, large hole where the chain was strung through. In the pointed end of the pendant, there was a smaller hole, lined with brass, that was just there for decoration. 

I loved my necklace and wore it often as a signature accessory piece. It was simple, lightweight, and elegant. A few weeks ago, when I was moving my things into a hotel room on my way to New York, I accidentally broke the chain and placed the necklace on my bedside table. It blended in too well, and I forgot to take it with me when we left. When I called the hotel, they said that nothing had been turned in. If I hadn’t lost it, I probably would be wearing it to class today.

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
      In this project, I familiarized myself with 2D primitives in the p5.js library, testing, sketching, and coding in the p5 editor. It was necessary to re-familiarize oneself with the Cartesian plane so that 2D shapes could be mapped accordingly.
<p>
  I included the following technical components in my sketch:
<p>* 2D primitives
<p>* fill() and blendMode()
<p>* Translate(), Rotate(), Push(), Pop()
      </p>

        Critique on the Physical Appearance of the Sketch
        <p>
Rachel was quite detailed in her description. The combination of detailed language, describing both the aesthetics of the necklace, as well as the feel of the necklace, clearly emphasizes the personal value and connection to the object. I do not think I did the necklace justice in my drawing due to lack of coding skills, but I did try to embody the positive feeling of wearing the necklace by adding an exaggerated smile to the person wearing it. I left the image black and white, using only colour for the necklace and the smile. This was to draw focus to the necklace and the positive feeling of wearing it. When looking at the necklace itself, a few aspects are off. The shape is not correct since I could not find a way to get a teardrop shape in p5.js. Furthermore, the 3D-aspect of the convex edge and thickness does not come through in this 2D image. In addition, the physical material (wood) does not shine through in the drawing. However, the colours and basic shapes did work quite effectively. I think it is clear how the necklace is strung through a hole in the top, and that it resembles a necklace. 

<p>
  ‘Lost in Translation’
  <p>
Ultimately, I think a lot of the essence was lost in translation between interpretation and coding. I don’t expect Rachel to identify with this image. Firstly, a small deal is lost during the communication process between her and me, due to my own interpretation. Secondly, an even greater deal is lost due to inefficient coding skills. This makes me more eager to learn more, so I can present something in the future that lies closer to my own expectations and resembles the image in my head more clearly.

<p>
  Drawing Freehand VS Drawing in Code
  <p>
Being completely new to coding, drawing has a lot more freedom at this point to me. Drawing has many different points of entry, and is something that was practiced by nearly the whole world from the age of three. This makes the thought process as adjusting to a different tool and media to try and convey something very interesting. Coming in with an idea, I had to adjust my expectation and the way I want to portray the image. I had to think about my image in terms of layers, what comes first, what is added on top. This makes you ‘draw’ in coding with a lot more intend. Contrastingly, in a physical drawing you can more easily add something around a drawing and are more free to start or end somewhere.
