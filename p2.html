      <p>
      The goal of this second week was to generate a face, which could be randomised through an instructions of selected variables. We had to implement the following technical components in our sketch: <p>
      *User-defined variables (),<p>
      *random (),<p>
      *mousePressed() or keyPressed().<p>
      The image changes shape and colour upon clicking your mouse, and some of the ‘holes’ response to the location of the mouse on the screen. 
      </p>

      <p>
      I was a bit intimidated by online sketching after our first project. I felt like I had little control online and could not translate my ideas into code. Therefor I started by physically drawing the face I wanted to create.<p>
      I wanted to implement everything I was shown in the class and lecture into my drawing, to make esure I propperly understood them and felt comfortable using the new skills. That is why I tried to lpay with random colour, size, and placement as possible. <p>

      <p>
        I translated a different sketch to p5js, since I realised my drawing was too ambitious for my skillset. I am happy I simplified the project, as I had a lot of fun during the programming process! Everything worked out as I wanted, and I drew with a lot more understanding compared to the first project. There was a lot less trial and error and more intend during this project. <p>
