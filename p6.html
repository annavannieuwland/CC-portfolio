       Design & Context 
      </h1>
    The weekend before the start of this project, I was reminiscing with a friend about my walking habits. I always hated to walk, and would always make bike everywhere, evenif it was only two minutes. In New York, this became the opposite. I wanted to create a data set that compare my personal means of transportation habits from the past with the present.
    It can seem as an insignificant dataset, but for me is a way that confirms the different life I am living; Related to my location of living. Biking for me was a huge part of my routine and life. I loved the freedom my bike gave me, and was a bit worried is I would miss that sense of 'freedom' in NY, missing home.  
    
    <p>
    I used the non-stop tracking of my Iphone to give me the following step count:

            When you click your mouse, the data is revealed. Although my dataset is not sensitive, and I would be open to sharing it with anyone, I was intriguiged by the idea of sensitive datasets. I wanted to explore a little how you could make a dataset more anonymous and hidden, only revealed to those with the right instructions and information.  
    Even though my data is not sensitive, it provided me an interesting analysis of how I spent my time, and which days I am exploring more and which days I am more working on school. Funy enough, the dataset made eme realize it is the opposite of last year; I spend my weekends exploring New York, and my weekdays for school, while in the past I would go out during the week and catch up on school and relax during the weekend.
        <p>
          Each flower representes a day, each circle of subtle dots is a waymark for 700 steps. The biggest flowerleaf pointing NW represents friday, and the rest fo the days afollow clockwise. 
          
    <p>A smaller leaf is representative of less steps taken that day. Vice versa for a bigger leaf.
        On friday and saturday, my night and day steps overlapped, since I walked home after 12pm. this is represented in the overlap between the pedals.

       Design Process 
      </h1>  
    I wanted to set three goals for myself during this project. Work with more organic, fluid shapes, to use the new information on arrays, and use blendmodes.
         <p>
           
  The array helped me to create the circle dots with little effort. It was the first tome using verbierVertex, and I liked the way the more organic shape of this project compared to all my previous static ones. I performed a detailed analysis of the steps throughout the day, at which time they peaked and at which time they ended. I had a more elaborate idea of impplementing that into the flower pedals, but did not feel confident on how to achieve this.  
Additionally, I still struggle with the blendmodes. I could not lock them in with the push pop setting, and a few parrts of my drawing are lost due to the blending. I still cannot understand how the blendmode affects the stroke weight and colour. The drawing looked nicer with the stroke details (both on thee drawing and the nonvisible extra elements) but hopefully I can correct this after the CC lab.
