       Design & Context

      <p>
During this assignment were were invited to use the principles of steganography to encode a secret message that can be decoded through instructions. The goal was to encorporate the following pseudocodes:
      <p>*looping and nested looping<p>
      
      <p> This project is dedicated to my hometown Antwerp. Two of the most iconic features (besides the cuisine) is diamonds and the harbour. 
        Antwerp is known as the diamond capital of the world and the diamond industry plays an important role in the economy of the city and has done throughout its history. 
        Zaha Hadid Architects has transformed an old fire station in Antwerp into new port headquarters. The modern addition reflects the changing colors of the water and sky and mimics the shape of a shipâ€™s bow pointing towards Scheldt, the river on which Antwerp was founded.<p>
      <p>
        In my design I tried to add three elements: diamond, fire and water reflection. The diamond triangles that rortate symbolize the constantly changing reflections of the water in the mirrors of the building. The fire burning subtly within is an ode to the old fire station. There is a seentence written in the middle, written in a 'street' flamish accent, which only people frmo Antwerp would understand and can relate too.
      <p>
        My intended recipient are people who grew in Antwerp; Those who would understand and appreciate the design elements and see it as a relfection fo the cities beauty.  
      <p> 
        The message can be decoded by constantly moving the mouse to show a small aspect of the letters. It's a puzzle the readere has to put together.

      <p>
The fire was created through loops, which were looped backwards to let us see the older particles on top. This worked very effectively in creating a fire like ambiance. 
       The trangle loops created an intersting diamondlike shape in my opinion, similarly to a kaleidoscope. This was an unexppected but pleasent result in my eyes.  
        
        <p>My Belgian identity has clearly been an inspiration for this project. verybody always draws form their own experiences, consciously or subconciously. This projct is a nice illustration of patriotic pride, and how it is easier to deisgn something for someone who can relate and recognize aspects. I think someone from Antwerp would view this differently than someone who is not familiar with Antwerp and this building.
