      <h1>
        Alternative Time Tracking || Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
During this assignment were were invited to challenge our concept of time and. its representation. We had to come up with three alternative methods of illustrating time. The goal was to encorporate the following pseudocodes:
      <p>*IF / ELSE Statement<p>
      *millis(), OR second() / minute() / hour()<p>
      *We were encouraged to integrate map() or the boolean variable when appropriate<p>
      
      <p> My alternative representations of time included:<p>
  1. Skyline time. This was inspired bythe different gradients in the sky during different hours of the day. At the last CC sharing, someone had worked with a gradient background, which I was excited to explore.   <p>
  2. Moon clock. The name itself is self explanatory. The clock would measure the length of each night, based on the presence of the moon. This plays off on how each night has a different length.  <p>
  3. Geometric expanding and shrinking clock. The clock would be based on three differet geometric shappes, expanding to its maximum towards mid-day, and shrinking again until it dissapears at midnight. <p> 
      <p>

      This image is from MFADT graduate kalyani tupkary. I had just participated in a guest lecture, where she introduced all different kinds of methods to measure time. It is extremely interesting and aligns perfectly with this weeks project! Her work can be found on this website: https://www.kalyanitupkary.com/calendar-collective and is worth a look.

      Since I was very excited to explore the use of colours in p5.js, I decided to work out the first clock.   

      <!-- 4. reflection -->
      <h1>
        My experimental clock
      </h1>
      <p>
This clock has an if else statement build in through the gradients. I tried to add a else if based on the hours of the day. My idea was that if it is before 12:00, the background would be white, causing the transparent colours to be lighter and more 'daylike'. If it would be after 12:00 (12:01-24:00), the background would shift to a black, resulting in a more dark pallet of colours to symbolzie the shift towards night time. 
<p> The hours slowely start at the top of the screen, as well as the minutes and seconds. They count down towards the bottom, all with a light transparancy, so each can be seen. The constantly changing size and colours of the rectangles creates a unique clock at any time of the day.
  <p> I added four different panels with different colours and brightnesses to represent the different timezones around the world. Moving here from Europe has caused my family and friends to live in a 6 hour different world. When I come back from class, they are already asleep. When I have brunch, they have dinner. I thought it would be fun to add a tribute to this period in my life, through this clock.  
<p> Furthermore, the clock reminds me of my 'natural body clock,' which is susceptible ' to the different skygradients. In the winter the colours transition to a more darker array, causing my body to react into wanting more sleep. The opposite holds for the summer. I liked the idea of having control over these gradient skies. <p>

        Reflection

      <p>
I enjoyed this project a lot. I found the challenge of deconstructing time very interesting. It was also the first project where I could create something that I could not create better through any other medium. It was the first time I understood the possibilities that p5.js can hold, and how they can help you create interesting, unique, constanlty changing images. 
        <p> Again, I was held back in my capabilites. My vision in my head did not fully translate to 'screen,' but it was the first time it actually surprised mewith the outcome in a positive manner. Hopefully the lerning curve goes up from here on onwards!
