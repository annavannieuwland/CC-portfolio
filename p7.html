       Design & Context 
      </h1>
This first game is a three scene working game that continuously loops to restart. The goal of my was to create a whimsical game, reflecing on how I would always do my very best to run away frm my piano lessons as a child. The scene contains an opening scene, explaining the key functions and theme. 
      The middle scene shows a little girls running over a piano, dodging musical notees to get to the other side. The final scene congratulates the player on succesfully dodging the music, with a cynical on how nothing was actually achieved. 
      The canvas size deviates slightly from the suggested canvas. I opted to change the canvas size because I initiallyw anted to create another mini game where the keys of the piano would be linked to sounds. Additionally, I thought the traditional one octave piano worked better visually.

Design & Context 
      </h1> 
      This game is an extension of the three scene game. It dos not fully work, as it stops working after a few runs. Therefor it was included as addition to the working assignment that was assigned.

Reflection
      </h1> 
The process of game creating was interesting. It showed that a lot more depth can be achieved through p5.js than I expected. The biggest struggle on this assignment was understanding and getting al the loops to work. As shown, I was not successfull in expanding my game with an additional looping mini game. After the fourth loop, the dots that make up the mini game do not show up. 
      Initially I wanted to explore using sound in p5.js, but the assignemnt proved to be challenging enough. This goal initially inspired me to created a piano game. Hopefully I can explore adding sound in one of my next projects!
      I am quite content with working oout how to play with different fonts in p5.js.
         <p>
           This also showed me options with playing with mulitple scenes, which I am considering to implement in my major studio prototyping.
