  My family's last name on my mothers side is “van Leeuwen,” which translates to “from lions” in English. Last weekend my whole family came together to celebrate my grandparents 60 years of marriage. This character is sort of the spirit animal behind our family. I wanted to tribute this project to celebrate them.

            Madeline Schlesinger: "My story is that I wanted to create a human version of my cat Sarge." The sketch is the human version of Sarge, with a picture added for clarification.

  Tricia Ilena: "I don't really have a correlation between that character and my life but wanted to create a quirky-looking and cheerful human - including bright colors and abnormally long hands and legs!"
 <p> 
   
  We made sure all three of us selected a different bodypart to ensure three different characters would be created. 
   
   <!-- 4. new story -->
      <h1>
        Standing Lion
      </h1>
      <p>
I opted to create the lions head, as it is the most iconic feature of the lion. I love the addition of the human-like legs, creating a hybrid human-cat-lion. New story: this is what my family would look like in an alternative uninverse. 
 
   <!-- 4. reflection -->
      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
During this assignment I encorporated the following pseudocodes:
      <p>*User-defined Functions<p>
      *Arguments and Parameters<p>
    It was good practice, as I covered similar content in my JavaScript elective, but did not fully understand it. Now I am connfident in defining and calling functions.  <p>
 <p> Each shape was created as a function and called for in draw. The mane is a combination of triangles, where the colour and rotation was changed when it was called for. The same goes for the legs. During this sketch, I also tried to play around witht different shape that I had not used before, as well as encoperating a few skills I had learned from earlier sketches. These included but are not limited to: gradients and if else statements for the eyes.
